# Internship-NameReverser
Name Reverser written for internship.

This tool revereses the names in one particular excel worksheet. It's written (read: bodged) toghether in VBA macros by someone who doesn't write VBA macros at all. It uses a form as it's interface.

I don't intend for this to be that useful to anyone, but it's GPL3 if anyone needs it.

See images below for example of it's use.
